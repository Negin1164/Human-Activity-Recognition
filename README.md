# Human-Activity-Recognition

The objective of this project is to identify various activities, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, using data collected from the smartphones carried by the study participants during their daily activities. These smartphones are equipped with an embedded inertial sensor that measures both acceleration and angular velocity along three mutually perpendicular axes.

The data collected includes:

 I. Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer comprising both total acceleration and estimated body acceleration.<br>
 II. Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.<br>
 III. A 561-feature vector containing time and frequency domain variables.<br>
 IV. Activity label.
